This project serves as a staring point for Flutter applications, it is an Attendance Portal app for Students with the Primary objective to minimize proxies and enhance accessibility for both students and staff. This application draws inspiration from a research paper, which can be accessed [here. ](https://journal.ump.edu.my/ijsecs/article/view/705/143) The research highlights the effectiveness of combining multiple verification methods to enhance attendance systems.
